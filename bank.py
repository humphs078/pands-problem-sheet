from decimal import Decimal

# Variable for amount 1 in cents and convert to Decimal class
amount_1 = Decimal(input("Enter amount 1 in (cent) "))

# Variable for amount 2 in cents and convert to Decimal class
amount_2 = Decimal(input("Enter amount 2 (in cent) "))

# variable to define the sum of the 2 amounts output and convert to euro.cents
euro_total = (amount_1 + amount_2)/100

# validation statement to check the class of the euro_total variable, commented out but left in to demonstrate that a
# check was performed to confirm the absense of floats
# print(type(euro_total))

# Final print statement, formatting a string
print(f"The total amount is â‚¬{euro_total}")
