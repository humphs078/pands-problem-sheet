# Script to return the square root of a number using Newton's method

# In numerical analysis, Newton's method, also known as the Newtonâ€“Raphson method, named after Isaac Newton and
# Joseph Raphson, is a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better approximations to the roots
# (or zeroes) of a real-valued function - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method Last Accessed 02/03/2023
