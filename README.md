## Description
This repository contains the solutions to the weekly tasks for the Programming and Scripting module on the ATU 
Mayo Galway H Dip in Computer Programming and Data Analytics.

## Scripts

### [Task 1 - Hello World](hello_world.py)

Week 1 Task - script to print **"Hello World!"** string in bold.

### [Task 2 - Bank](bank.py)

Week 2 task - script to enter two amounts in cents, add them and print out the total in human-readable format.
The output has a euro sign in front of the total. Euros and cents are separated by a decimal point.

**Reflection** - The challenge was to print euro total to 2 decimal places as a result of formatting.
[Solution 1](http://programarcadegames.com/index.php?chapter=formatting&lang=en) (last accessed 02/02/2023) was found 
here. That solution was later commented out and the following format string 
[solution 2](https://java2blog.com/format-a-float-to-two-decimal-places/) (last accessed 02/03/2023) 
was implemented in line 24 of code.

### [Task 3 - Accounts](accounts.py)

Week 3 Task - Script to read in a bank account number display only the last 4 digits and mask the rest.

Assumptions:

+ the account number has to be 10 numbers. It cannot be greater or less than 10 numbers in length.
+ the account number can only contain numbers. It cannot contain letters.
+ loop statements and the use of if and else statements are permitted in the script.

**Reflection** - the challenge was to create the code so that the user could only enter a 10-digit number. The 
[solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25457923/how-to-make-python-goto-a-previous-line-to-get-more-input), 
last accessed 11/02/2023, was to implement a "while loop" so that if the user enters anything but a 10-digit number the
code loops back and instructs the user that what they have entered is not valid and to re-enter a valid input.

### [Task 3a - Accounts Modified](task_3_accounts_modified.py)

Week 3 task - Script to read in bank account number of any length and display the last 4 digits of the account number 
for account numbers greater than 4 digits in length.

### [Task 4 - Collatz](task_4_collatz.py)

Week 4 task - Script to read out the Collatz sequence for any positive integer the user reads in.

Named after mathematician Lothar Collatz, the Collatz conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic 
operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) (last accessed 02/03/2023).

**Reflection** - The challenge was if a user read in a value of 1. No function or script could be found to mitigate 
against this so a crude solution was implemented in lines 25 - 28 of the script. If the integer 1 is read in there is 
only 1 possible thus the overhead of three additional lines of code was considered justified for the sake of 
completeness.

### [Task 5 - Weekday](task_5_weekday.py)

Week 5 task - Script to read out a message indicating if today is a weekday or the weekend.

This script was tested on both a **weekday and weekend** to ensure that the output was correct.

**Reflection** - the challenge was that the days of the week are outputted as integer values. An "if" statement was used 
to translate the day of the week to out a string indicating if it is a weekday or the weekend

### [Task 6 - Square Root](task_6_square_root.py)
Week 6 task - Script to return the square root of a number using Newton's method.

In numerical analysis, Newton's method, also known as the Newtonâ€“Raphson method, named after Isaac Newton and
Joseph Raphson, is a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better approximations to the roots
(or zeroes) of a real-valued function - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) 
(last accessed 02/03/2023).

**Reflection** - the precision of the output was the challenge. Precision was achieved by the use of a "for" loop
iterating 100 times within a function.

### [Task 7 - Count of the letter **e**](task_7_es.py)
Week 7 task - Script to count the number of times the letter "e" appears in a text file. The text file is read in as an argument
from the command line as an argument e.g. python task_7_es.py some_file.txt


Assumptions:

+ The user wants to count the letter "e" in the given text file. The letter can be changed by changing the argument
in line 40 of the code.
+ The .txt file will be stored in the same directory as the task_7_es.py script.

**Reflection** - The challenge was running the script from the command line with the desired text file being read in as
a command line argument. This was solved by using sys library and using the sys.argv[1] in a global variable. The use 
of global variables in functions is not encouraged however is justified in this use case.

### [Task 8 - Plotting](task_8_plottask.py)

Week 8 task - Script called plottask.py that displays a histogram of a normal distribution of 1000 values with a mean
of 5 and standard deviation of 2 and a plot of the function  h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 10] on the one set of axes.

**Reflection** - The challenge was formatting the outputted plot chart in a presentable way that is easily read. The 
solution was to implement a number of font and plot formatting options in the code.
